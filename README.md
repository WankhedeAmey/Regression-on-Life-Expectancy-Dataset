# Regression-on-Life-Expectancy-Dataset

Predicted Life-Expectancy of a person based on different factors like country, year, development-status, income, gdp, population, etc. 

Used 2/3rd of data for the training purpose and 1/3rd of the data for the testing purpose.

For the most accurate predictions, Cleaned the dataset of any empty entries. 

Used the following regression models for predictions :
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression

Appropriate metrics are used for the measurement of efficiency of the models used. Used scaling of data to improve the results. Also used one-hot encoding to consider discrete data along with the continuos data for the best possible predictions. 

Once the model was working well on training data, model was tested on test data; where it worked well. Resulting graphs are printed as metrics for this performance.
